# Do-or-die-fitness-tracker

Aims - incentive for healthier life by gamifying health fitness tracker

Thoughts so far:

**CORE FUNCTIONALITIES:**
* Record steps with the gyrometer in M5Stack (implementation needs to compensate for gravity/acceleration)
* Desktop => management database software to track how many users there are?
* Web => displays more analytics data of your stats e.g. health/level?
* IoT => mobile app?

**ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES:**
* Can design your own character (like a tamagotchi character?) => double personas (bad and good characters?)
* Social => compete with friends, or rewards for exercising with friends
* Achievement unlocker
* WIFI module => can be used for location tracker (function call to return a dummy location) => for tracking distance run?
* GPS tracker to discourage pubs?
* Shaking the M5Stack will make the character: 1. voice "stop shaking me", 2. animate shaking character
* Mystery button: poking the character makes it voice cute sounds?
  
M5STACK MODULES:
* Decibel meter?
* Additional LED => green for healthy, red for unhealthy/dying?
