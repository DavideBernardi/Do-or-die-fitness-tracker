## 6. Workplan with sprints
We organised our work as a series of one-week sprints from early March to mid-May. We met in person or talk as a group over Google hangouts each Monday at 3pm for a sprint review/retrospective. The work over from the last week was presented and discussed and completed items marked as "done". The to-does for the coming week/sprint as well as the backlog for later sprints was agreed upon. The coding pairs for the different substreams we had bilateral "stand-ups" to check on how the work is progressing and problem-solve. Also, we interactions between substreams as needed during the week. In the following we listed all the items for the week as “WIP” (Work-in-progress) or “Done”. The backlog was moved to later sprints. (in the end only Done items will remain on the list)
### Sprint 1 Define Architecture & Interactions (2.3-9.3) 
The goal of this sprint was to agree upon our architecture and the interactions so that the workstream would know how to design their sub-systems.
**Done**
*Defined and agreed on overall infrastructure (shared on Slack)
*Defined MVP with functions/classes/variables
*Defined interactions between subsystems including the function calls and their JSON syntax 
### Sprint 2 First Prototype (9.3-16.3) 
The goal of this sprint was to create a very basic proof of concept.
**Done**
*M5 Stack able to send a notification to server (Processing) for each new step
*Processing able to process the notification, calculate the total steps and send it back to the M5
*M5 able to process message from processing and display total steps
*Created web design and mockup pages
### Sprint 3 Fight corona and finish other coursework (16.3-30.3) 
Due to the corona situation and the coursework deadlines, the team agreed to push all work to the backlog and not meet until after the deadline.
### Sprint 4 Version Alpha (30.3-4.4) 
The goal of this sprint is to get an alpha version of our prototype ready. This involves:
**WIP**
*All subsystem able to receive, process and send the intended MQTT commands
*All subsystems provide a basic version of the agreed visualization 
### Sprint 5 Beta Version (6.4-13.4) 
### Sprint 6 Refactor and neaten-up (13.4-20.4) 
### Sprint 7 Prepare Pitch (20.3-27.4) 
### Sprint 8 Write-up (27.4-4.5) 




## 7. Design evaluation
