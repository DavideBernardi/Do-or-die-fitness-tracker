# Do-or-die-fitness-tracker

Aims - incentive for healthier life by gamifying health fitness tracker

Thoughts so far:

**CORE FUNCTIONALITIES:**
* Record steps with the gyrometer in M5Stack (implementation needs to compensate for gravity/acceleration)
* Desktop => management database software to track how many users there are?
* Web => displays more analytics data of your stats e.g. health/level?
* IoT => mobile app?

**ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES:**
* Can design your own character (like a tamagotchi character - or a bean!?) => double personas (bad and good characters?)
* Social => compete with friends, or rewards for exercising with friends
* Achievement unlocker 
* WIFI module => can be used for location tracker (function call to return a dummy location) => for tracking distance run?
* GPS tracker to discourage pubs? - more desired?
* Shaking the M5Stack will make the character: 1. voice "stop shaking me", 2. animate shaking character
* Mystery button: poking the character makes it voice cute sounds?

**DESIRED FUNCTIONALITIES:** (What we want to add but probably wont have time for)
* Track extended range of motions from the gyro for different exercises e.g. squats, starjumps, sit ups, push ups, etc (ice skating(!)) 
* Evolution of the tamagotchi-esque avatar with increasing levels (& different modes for different moods? ie - drunk mode, etc)
* Integration with real fitness brands as sponsors, e.g. 10% off protein bars to sell at in-game shop
* Augmented reality version so that you can see a gamified version of real life, and levels above players heads
* Location tracking - at the pub / at the gym / etc.? 
* More social aspects on the desktop app, messaging friends to taunt / cheer them on? 
  
**M5STACK MODULES:**
* Decibel meter?
* Additional LED => green for healthy, red for unhealthy/dying?
