# 3. Project Evaluation [20pts]:
## a. Reflective discussion of the success of the project
## b. Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
## c. Group Working Practices
Our group undertook an Agile workflow while completing our project. This allowed us to embrace changing requirements, and ensured that when our working methods had to become remote, we were prepared and did not fall behind. Our working practices, methods for communication, and their relative success in terms of our group's working practice, will be considered in turn. 

### AGILE COMMUNICATION 

Our working process was highly centred on the Agile principle, which are evident in a number of our working practices. We also focused mainly on using the Kanban framework, as it ensured that we had a full transparency of the work that was left to be done. We also chose to implement some methods of the Scrum process in our team, in particular organising weekly code sprints with the aim of deploying a working version of our code at the end of each sprint. 

We began work on our project by breaking down our work in to user stories which are described in further detail in [the System Design section](../Portfolio/SystemDesign.md) of our portfolio. We began by ensuring that we had a clear focus of project requirements, as well as how long we expected each requirement to take, and prioritise which would come first. 

While it was tempting at times to work solely on the subsystem that you were focused on, we found it easier to visualize our work in a [Gantt chart](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ac16888_bristol_ac_uk/EXltfbLEnNFLrGLOGOxgZcIB2oqj_ft_TP9LevpsozfhVg?e=TUTMn7). Doing this allowed our team to see how each key user story was being implemented, when it was complete, and how each user story linked together between the subsystems. By making these user stories our priority during each of our sprints, we were able to focus on what was most important to delivering our final product, and also ensure that each story was given the appropriate time during our project. 

Our group measured our progress by working at a constant pace, and constantly ensuring that we had a working system. One of our first goals as a group was to ensure that our key subsystems were able to communicate between each other, and we constnatly maintained this by breaking away each week to work on the subsystems and coming together to test them. During our weekly testing meetings, we would ensure that we had a current working project. Once we were satisfied with the quality of our code, and that everything worked as it should, we released Version 0.1 and 0.2 of our product two weeks a part. Following this, we released Version 1.0 and Version 1.1. 

These releases were planned in advance, by utilising the milestone feature on Github we were able to work towards each milestone and prioritise which issues had to be addressed before our first release. To ensure that all the work was transparent, we utilised the Kanban project board on Github in combination with Github issues. This will be addressed later on in this section. 

**KANBAN AND SCRUM FRAMEWORKS**

### GITHUB PROCCESS

Our team utilised Github in a number of ways. In order to keep it clear across team members how we wanted to push code to our develop branch, we developed the following method for using Github: 

<p align="center"> 
  1. Create a new branch for each feature and ensure that you pull from develop frequently.
  
  2. When you are done working on that feature, create a pull request. 
  
  3. If applicable, link it to an existing issue to be clear what you are fixing. Likewise, link it to the applicable project Kanban board so the other team members can see the work that is being done. 
  
  4. Another team member, typically your partner working on the same subsystem, will either approve your pull request, or request changes. 
  
  5. You can then merge your branch with develop, marking the issue as closed. 
  
  6. Ensure that you attach your pull request to the applicable milestone (each version that we planned to release, including Alpha and Beta versions). 
  
  7. Delete the branch and repeat!</p> 

Linking our Kanban board with our issues helped to greater clarify who was responsible for what issues, and whether they were still in the 'To Do' category or 'In Progress'. Similarly, by then linking it with the pull requests each team member was able to see the work that was being completed and the attached code. This ensured that every team member was on the same page as to the work that was being done, who needed to complete it, and when it had been done. 

The greatest negative to our team's use of Github was the relative inexperience that each team member had with a large number of the features. It took each of us a while to get used to the test driven development cycle, and to ensure that we were branching off of develop and creating a pull request for each new feature. However, once we all began to get in to the habit of following the above work cycle the success became clear and our progress began to excelerate. Similarly, there was less confusion as to who was responsible for which parts of the project. 

### COMMUNICATION TOOLS

While our group communicated most frequently through Facebook messenger, due to it being the most popular messaging platform amongst our group, we chose to use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) to keep track of more important messages. 
![Slack](/Portfolio/Images/slack.png) 
The main channels that we used in our Slack organisation were core_functionalities, general, issues, and ideas. 
* **core_functionalities**: this channel was used to keep track of our MQTT request types, and our diagrams on how we planned for our subsystems to interact. 
* **general**: this channel was used for more general questions, resources, and important messages that we did not want to loose in our messenger chat. 
* **issues**: prior to creating an issue on github, we used this channel to highlight any specific issues we thought may arise and whether others thought that they needed to be addressed. 
* **ideas**: here we each posted future functionalities and ideas we had about how to improve our product. 

By linking our Github with Slack, each team member was also notified when another team member had created a pull request or pushed to Github.

### OVERALL REFLECTION ON GROUP WORKING PRACTICES

While Agile was a new concept to most members of our group, and some of us were hesitant to focus our work around it, we found that it was incredibly beneficial especially when our working practices changed in mid-March. Without in-person interactions, we relied heavily on the Kanban board and our weekly Google Hangout meetings that our code sprints were focused around. This allowed for us to adapt to issues as they arose, and ensure that we constantly had a working product in our master branch. Moreover, it kept each member of the team on the same page as to what work everyone else was doing, and we made for clear communication that we did not feel was affected to drastically by our move to working remotely.
