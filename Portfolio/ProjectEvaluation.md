# 3. Project Evaluation [20pts]:
## a. Reflective discussion of the success of the project
## b. Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
## c. Group Working Practices
Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work,
e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).

While our group communicated most frequently through Facebook messenger, due to it being the most popular messaging platform amongst our group, we chose to use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) to keep track of more important messages.

The main channels that we used in our Slack organisation were core_functionalities, general, issues, and ideas. 
* **core_functionalities**: this channel was used to keep track of our MQTT request types, and our diagrams on how we planned for our subsystems to interact. 
* **general**: this channel was used for more general questions, resources, and important messages that we did not want to loose in our messenger chat. 
* **issues**: prior to creating an issue on github, we used this channel to highlight any specific issues we thought may arise and whether others thought that they needed to be addressed. 
* **ideas**: here we each posted future functionalities and ideas we had about how to improve our product. 

## d. This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote
working practices etc)
