# 3. Project Evaluation [20pts]:
## a. Reflective discussion of the success of the project
## b. Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)
## c. Group Working Practices
Our group used a variety of means to communicate, especially in light of the coronavirus situation. We followed the Agile communication practices, and communicated through Facebook messenger and Slack. We utilised many of Githubs features including their Project boards, to manage our issues. Each of these communication practices, and their relative success in terms of our group's working practice, will be considered in turn.

**GITHUB PROCCESS**

Our team utilised Github in a number of ways. In order to keep it clear across team members how we wanted to push code to our develop branch, we developed the following method for using Github in our team: 

<p align="center"> 
  1. Create a new branch for each feature and ensure that you pull from develop frequently. 
  2. When you are done working on that feature, create a pull request. 
  3. If applicable, link it to an existing issue to be clear what you are fixing. Likewise, link it to the applicable project Kanban board so the other team members can see the work that is being done. 
  4. Another team member, typically your partner working on the same subsystem, will either approve your pull request, or request changes. 
  5. You can then merge your branch with develop, marking the issue as closed. 
  6. Ensure that you attach your pull request to the applicable milestone (each version that we planned to release, including Alpha and Beta versions). 
  7. Delete the branch and repeat!

Linking our Kanban board with our issues helped to greater clarify who was responsible for what issues, and whether they were still in the 'To Do' category or 'In Progress'. Similarly, by then linking it with the pull requests each team member was able to see the work that was being completed and the attached code. This ensured that every team member was on the same page as to the work that was being done, who needed to complete it, and when it had been done. 

The greatest negative to our team's use of Github was the relative inexperience that each team member had with a large number of the features. It took each of us a while to get used to the test driven development cycle, and to ensure that we were branching off of develop and creating a pull request for each new feature. However, once we all began to get in to the habit of following the above work cycle the success became clear and our progress began to excelerate. Similarly, there was less confusion as to who was responsible for which parts of the project.

**COMMUNICATION METHODS**

While our group communicated most frequently through Facebook messenger, due to it being the most popular messaging platform amongst our group, we chose to use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) to keep track of more important messages. 
![Slack](/Portfolio/Images/slack.png) 
The main channels that we used in our Slack organisation were core_functionalities, general, issues, and ideas. 
* **core_functionalities**: this channel was used to keep track of our MQTT request types, and our diagrams on how we planned for our subsystems to interact. 
* **general**: this channel was used for more general questions, resources, and important messages that we did not want to loose in our messenger chat. 
* **issues**: prior to creating an issue on github, we used this channel to highlight any specific issues we thought may arise and whether others thought that they needed to be addressed. 
* **ideas**: here we each posted future functionalities and ideas we had about how to improve our product. 

By linking our Github with Slack, each team member was also notified when another team member had created a pull request or pushed to Github.
